# Overview

This repository contains a Python function to classify packages into different stacks based on their dimensions and mass. It also includes a test suite to verify correctness.

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/fde-technical-screen.git
cd fde-technical-screen
```

### 2. (Optional) Create a Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
```

### 3. Run the Sorting Function
```bash
python main.py
```
This will execute the function and print a sample result.

### 4. Run Tests
```bash
python -m unittest discover -v
```
This will run all tests with verbose output, showing:
- The name of each test being run
- The test's docstring description
- Whether each test passed or failed
- A summary of all test results
